if command == 1
    --> check if builtin
    --> check if $?
    --> else search path to execute

if command > 1
    --> check if in/out file
        --> which type of in/out
    --> allocate for xx amount of pipes (check PATH could be that it was unset, then return)
    --> sent the "regular path" or "delimiter path"


QUESTION
    -- can the builtins also be part of a "pipe line" or always on their own?
        YES can be part of a pipeline/series of commands
